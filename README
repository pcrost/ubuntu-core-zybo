Digilent Zybo board with 8GB SD card (or higher)
LAN 

DEPENDENCIES

I am using Ubuntu 14.04. The following packages are needed:

sudo apt-get install \
    mtools gcc-arm-linux-gnueabi git \
    libfdt-dev \
    pv sshpass

pv and sshpass are optional but do make the board download experience more
friendly.

Other distros should work fine, for older distros the hardest part is going
to be getting arm-gcc which may not be present in your package manager.

I assume you have access to the LAN controls (at home this usually means
"the router password"). If you are at work this may mean access to the lab
LAN. Some people just setup a small LAN on their desk they can control,
otherwise you need IT support or some hacks to find out what IP your board
got for DHCP lease.

DOWNLOAD SOURCES:

Clone this repo:

git clone https://github.com/pcrost/ubuntu-core-zybo.git
cd ubuntu-core-zybo

BUILD:

./build-core myimg

NETWORK DOWNLOAD:

I am assuming your Zybo board is fresh and has the factory Linux image in
QSPI flash. If you are using a second-hand board or have been doing QSPI
work you may not have this installed. You can re-image your board or use SD
card image instructions instead if this is the case.

If you don't know what I am taking about, it's more likely that your board
does work than doesn't.

Put your Zybo board in QSPI boot mode (the jumper near the VGA port).
Plug in LAN cable on same network as dev PC.
Open up LAN settings and look up LAN devices. Note what is there.
Power on board. Wait about 15 sec or so,
Refresh LAN devices. There should be a new device. Note its IP.

Download SD image to the board:
./do-net-download myimg <board-ip>

Reconfigure jumper for SD boot. Power cycle the board.

SD CARD DOWNLOAD (root required):

Eject the SD card from the Zybo and put in your dev machine
Figure out the dev node for the sd card. You want the dev node for the
disk itself not the partitions. E.g. /dev/mmcblk0 NOT d/dev/mmcblk0_p0.

sudo dd if=myimg of=</dev/devnode> bs=16k
sync

Put the SD card back in the board
Put your Zybo board in SD boot mode (the jumper near the VGA port).

QEMU BOOT:

./qemu-boot myimg

This will boot the image in an emulator.

RUNNING:

Once running, look up the board IP in your LAN settings. ssh to it:

ssh ubuntu@<board-ip>

Login with the password "ubuntu"
